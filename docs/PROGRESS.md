# Project Progress

## Latest
Updated: 2026-05-15 11:04 (Asia/Shanghai)

### 1) Current Progress
- `INSTANCE-1` completed: added the `agent_instances` table, `/api/instances` status APIs, SDK helpers, and `docs/MODULE_instances.md`.
- Codex bridge now reports runtime status through TALK: startup `idle`, per-task `busy`, success back to `idle`, error/timeout to `error`, and shutdown to `offline`.
- Instance API coverage added in `tests/test_instances.py`; SDK helper coverage added in `tests/test_talk_client.py`.
- Instance bridge smoke test passed in an isolated temporary TALK server/database/storage: `agent:codex` followed `idle -> busy -> idle -> offline` and replied with `TALK_BRIDGE_INSTANCE_SMOKE_OK`.
- `TASK-1` completed: added `agent_tasks`, `/api/tasks`, SDK helpers, sync SDK wrappers, and route / SDK test coverage.
- First scheduler boundary is now explicit: TALK records and routes tasks to already-running bridge processes; it does not auto-start Codex / Claude / pi processes in this slice.
- Task lifecycle first version supports `queued -> running -> succeeded / failed / canceled`; task claim and completion update linked instance status and `current_task_id`.
- Project rules updated: development execution Agents may directly update `docs/PROGRESS.md` after real code, test, or documentation work.
- Documentation synced: `docs/MODULE_tasks.md` added; `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/MODULE_instances.md`, `docs/LOCAL_LAB_DESIGN.md`, and `docs/SDK.md` updated for task APIs.
- `SETUP-UX-2` completed: first-admin setup page now shows the `管理员 ID` format hint, renames `显示名称` to `昵称`, validates `human:*` before submit, and changes the create-admin button to a compact bordered primary button with stronger contrast.
- `SETUP-UX-2` follow-up: setup page now cache-busts `style.css` / `app.js`, puts primary button contrast classes directly on the button, and localizes clipboard failure into a Chinese fallback that selects the login key for manual `Ctrl+C` copy.
- `CHAT-UI-1` completed: chat page residual English copy was localized, search toolbar and composer controls were visually separated, and the empty message timeline now explains its purpose.
- `WEB-VISUAL-1` completed: login/setup and the main chat workspace now use a cohesive dark console visual system with stronger panel boundaries, clearer status/search/composer hierarchy, refined message bubbles, responsive overflow safeguards, and updated cache-busting assets.
- `WEB-VISUAL-2` completed: after reviewing the `image_gen` mockup direction, the real chat page now groups online members and history/search controls into a unified workspace tools panel above the message timeline, while keeping the left channel/sidebar concept deferred until Group/Hall exists.
- `WEB-VISUAL-2` verification follow-up completed: real authenticated Chrome headless screenshots caught and fixed a CSS cascade bug where the drag/drop hint overlay stayed visible and blocked the composer.
- `GROUP-1 / HALL-1` backend first slice completed: added Group and GroupMember persistence, `/api/groups` CRUD-style membership APIs, `messages.group_id`, and group-scoped Hall message visibility.
- Group Hall semantics are intentionally distinct from legacy direct messages: inside a Group, `to_ids` records attention/mentions, while all Group members can read the Hall timeline; unscoped `GET /api/messages` continues to return only legacy/global messages.
- Project role boundary updated: Codex is now authorized as a decision Agent for this project and may directly maintain relevant project/module/progress/decision documentation.
- Group/Hall documentation synced: `docs/MODULE_groups.md` added and `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` updated with the new tables, route, module index entry, and 2026-05-14 addendum.
- `WEB-GROUP-1` completed: Web UI now has a room strip for global timeline / Group Hall switching, a new Group panel with initial member selection, active Group persistence, scoped Hall history/轮询/发送, scoped `@` autocomplete, and scoped online member display.
- `SDK-GROUP-1` completed: async and sync SDK clients now expose Group helpers and support `group_id` on `send_text`, `send_file`, `reply`, and `fetch_history`.
- SDK group helper coverage added in `tests/test_talk_client.py`; docs synced in `docs/SDK.md`, `docs/MODULE_groups.md`, and `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.
- `WEB-GROUP-MEMBERS-1` completed: Web UI Hall now has an expandable members panel; human users can add members, adjust roles, and remove other members from the active Group.
- Group member changes refresh the active Group snapshot, room description, scoped presence strip, and `@` autocomplete immediately.
- `SSE-1` completed: added read-only `GET /api/events?token=...` Server-Sent Events with `presence`, `message`, `revoke`, and heartbeat `ping` events.
- The realtime hub now fans out message/revoke/presence updates to both WebSocket connections and SSE queues; online member accounting includes the WebSocket/SSE union.
- SSE route coverage added in `tests/test_sse.py`; docs synced in `docs/MODULE_websocket.md` and `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

### 2) Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The improved first-run setup flow still lacks one real browser smoke test for “empty DB -> create admin -> auto login -> reopen -> normal login form”.
- The task card asks for a second clean-session newcomer dry run and readability feedback; that external acceptance has not been performed yet in this environment.
- The multi-Agent discussion phase still needs a concrete protocol: moderator responsibilities, round limits, stop conditions, material-sharing rules, and summary output format are discussed conceptually but not yet written into an implementation spec.
- The document editing coordination protocol still needs implementation-level rules: lock granularity, lock timeout, stale-lock recovery, read-only review behavior, conflict handling, and UI/API visibility.
- The local `pi` framework entrypoint, configuration style, and DeepSeek / Kimi adapter shape still need to be verified on this workstation before bridge implementation.
- Codex bridge is still MVP-level: it does not yet stream partial output, attach files/materials, or enforce document-edit locks.
- Scheduler v2 details remain open: delayed / recurring schedule table shape, task retry policy, timeout recovery for stale `running` tasks, and whether Web UI can manually requeue or cancel tasks.
- Web UI has not integrated the new SSE stream yet; it still relies on WebSocket plus HTTP polling fallback.
- SSE currently provides live read-only events only; `Last-Event-ID` replay/backfill is not implemented.
- Group rename/delete controls and unread/attention state are still pending.

### 3) Next Plan
- Continue refining the unified bridge contract for hybrid backends: local CLI bridges for `Claude Code` / `Codex`, `pi`-based bridges for `Kimi` / `DeepSeek`, and a shared TALK-facing message/file interface.
- Define the first multi-Agent discussion protocol: moderator-led turns, bounded rounds, automatic transcript retention, summary generation, controlled material/document passing, and document-edit coordination.
- Next implementation candidates: Web UI SSE fallback/integration, SSE `Last-Event-ID` replay/backfill, Group rename/delete UI, document-edit lock API, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.

### 4) Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_tasks` passed with `7` tests.

- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- After the Web UI polish changes, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` was rerun and passed with `74` tests.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` returned `200`; in-app browser automation connection still timed out before refresh, so visual recheck is pending manual refresh.
- A follow-up in-app browser automation attempt against `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` timed out again during browser connection; `/healthz` remained healthy.
- After `WEB-VISUAL-1`, `node --check web\app.js`, `tests.test_encoding`, full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest`, and `git diff --check` all passed; Chrome headless screenshots were used for visual checks because the Codex in-app browser connection still timed out.
- After `WEB-VISUAL-2`, `node --check web\app.js`, `tests.test_encoding`, full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest`, and `git diff --check` all passed; Chrome headless screenshots were regenerated for the real login page and a temporary chat-shell preview at desktop and 500px widths.
- After the `WEB-VISUAL-2` follow-up fix, `node --check web\app.js`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding`, `git diff --check`, and full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` all passed; Chrome headless verified authenticated chat at 1440px and 500px with `#drop-hint` computed as `display: none`.
- After `GROUP-1 / HALL-1`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_messages`, `node --check web\app.js`, `git diff --check`, and full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` all passed; full suite is now `81` tests.
- After documentation sync, `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- After `WEB-GROUP-1`, `node --check web\app.js` passed; Chrome headless smoke test against an isolated temporary TALK server verified login, Group creation with `agent:codex`, Hall message send, Hall placeholder, and that switching back to global hides the Hall message; `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups tests.test_messages` passed with `26` tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only; full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `81` tests.
- After `SDK-GROUP-1`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_talk_client` passed with `10` tests.
- Full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `82` tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- After `WEB-GROUP-MEMBERS-1`, `node --check web\app.js` passed; `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups tests.test_messages` passed with `26` tests.
- Chrome headless smoke test against an isolated temporary TALK server verified login, Group creation, members panel open, member add, role update, member removal, and no horizontal overflow at desktop and 500px widths.
- After `WEB-GROUP-MEMBERS-1`, full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `82` tests; `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- After `SSE-1`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_sse` passed with `3` tests.

## History

### 2026-05-15 11:04 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SSE-1` completed: added read-only `GET /api/events?token=...` as a Server-Sent Events stream for clients that cannot or should not hold a WebSocket.
- SSE authentication uses the existing API key member resolution path; invalid tokens return `401`.
- The stream emits `presence`, `message`, `revoke`, and idle `ping` events; `message` and `revoke` include SSE `id:` set to the message id.
- `server/ws_hub.py` now fans out realtime updates to both WebSocket connections and per-member SSE queues, drops the oldest queued SSE event when a member queue is full, and counts online members across the WebSocket/SSE union.
- Added live streaming tests for invalid token rejection, presence/message delivery, and revoke delivery.
- Synced `docs/MODULE_websocket.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and this progress file.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Web UI has not integrated the new SSE stream yet; this slice only provides the backend event contract.
- SSE `Last-Event-ID` replay/backfill is not implemented; clients should still use message history APIs after reconnect when they need gap recovery.
#### Next Plan
- Continue with one of: Web UI SSE fallback/integration, SSE `Last-Event-ID` replay/backfill, Group rename/delete UI, document-edit lock API, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_sse` passed with `3` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_websocket` passed with `10` tests.
- Full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `85` tests.
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.

### 2026-05-15 10:52 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WEB-GROUP-MEMBERS-1` completed: active Group Hall now exposes a members panel from the top room strip.
- Human users can add members not yet in the Group, update member roles among `owner / moderator / member`, and remove other members.
- Agent users retain a read-only member list in the UI; server-side permission remains authoritative.
- Successful member changes replace the active Group snapshot and immediately refresh room metadata, scoped presence, and `@` autocomplete.
- Static asset cache-busting updated to `20260515-group-members`.
- Synced `docs/MODULE_webui.md`, `docs/MODULE_groups.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and this progress file.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- No new open questions from this slice.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next slice from: SSE stream event contract, Group rename/delete UI, document-edit lock API, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups tests.test_messages` passed with `26` tests.
- Chrome headless smoke test against an isolated temporary TALK server verified login, Group creation, members panel open, member add, role update, member removal, and no horizontal overflow at desktop and 500px widths.

- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-15 10:37 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SDK-GROUP-1` completed: async SDK now exposes `create_group`, `list_groups`, `get_group`, `upsert_group_member`, and `remove_group_member`.
- Sync SDK parity added for the same Group helpers; sync `reply()` was also exposed for parity with the async client.
- Message helpers now support Hall scope: `send_text`, `send_file`, `reply`, and `fetch_history` can carry `group_id`.
- Added live SDK coverage that creates a Group, updates/removes a member, sends a Hall message, reads Hall history as an Agent, and verifies the Hall message does not leak into legacy/global history.
- Synced `docs/SDK.md`, `docs/MODULE_groups.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and this progress file.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- No new open questions from this slice.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next slice from: SSE stream event contract, Group member management UI, document-edit lock API, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_talk_client` passed with `10` tests.
- Full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `82` tests.

### 2026-05-14 16:33 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WEB-GROUP-1` completed: Web UI now exposes a real Group/Hall room strip above the workspace tools.
- Added global timeline / Group Hall switching, `GET /api/groups` loading, active Group persistence per user, and disabled entries for Groups the current user cannot enter.
- Added a lightweight new Group panel with name, optional ID, optional description, and initial member checkboxes; creation succeeds through `POST /api/groups` and automatically enters the new Hall.
- Hall scope now flows through the browser: history and polling include `group_id`, text/file send payloads include `group_id`, WebSocket events are appended only when they belong to the active room, and switching rooms clears reply state.
- Hall UX now scopes online members and `@` autocomplete to the current Group members and uses a placeholder that states Hall mentions are reminders rather than visibility restrictions.
- Synced `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/MODULE_webui.md`, `docs/MODULE_groups.md`, and this progress file.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Group member management after creation, Group rename/delete, unread/attention state, SDK helpers, SSE stream integration, and multi-Agent discussion protocol remain future slices.
#### Next Plan
- Commit this Web UI Group/Hall follow-up if accepted.
- Then continue with one of: SDK group helpers, Group member management UI, SSE stream events, document-edit locks, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- Chrome headless smoke test against an isolated temporary TALK server/database/storage verified login, Group creation with `agent:codex`, Hall message send, Hall-specific placeholder, and that switching back to global hides the Hall message.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups tests.test_messages` passed with `26` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- Full `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `81` tests.
#### Changed Files

- `web/style.css`
- `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/MODULE_groups.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 16:03 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Project role boundary updated: Codex is now authorized as a decision Agent and can maintain relevant project/module/progress/decision docs directly.
- Group/Hall docs synced after `GROUP-1 / HALL-1`: added `docs/MODULE_groups.md`.
- Updated `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` with `groups`, `group_members`, `messages.group_id`, `server/routes/groups.py`, the module index entry, and the 2026-05-14 Group/Hall addendum.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None for documentation sync.
#### Next Plan
- Commit the current Web UI + Group/Hall backend + documentation set when accepted.
- Then choose the next slice: Web UI Group/Hall navigation, SDK group helpers, SSE stream events, document-edit locks, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
#### Changed Files
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/MODULE_groups.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 15:54 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `GROUP-1 / HALL-1` backend first slice completed from the confirmed contract.
- Added `groups` and `group_members` tables, `messages.group_id`, startup migration/index creation, `/api/groups` creation/list/detail/member add/update/remove APIs, and group-scoped message send/history behavior.
- Group Hall visibility now treats `to_ids` as mention/attention inside a Group: all Group members can read the Hall timeline, while non-members are rejected and old unscoped message history remains legacy/global only.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Documentation sync for `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and a new/updated Group/Hall module doc still needs explicit approval.
- Web UI Group/Hall navigation and SDK helpers are not implemented yet.
#### Next Plan
- If approved, sync Group/Hall docs and commit the current work.
- Otherwise continue with one follow-up slice: Web UI Group/Hall navigation, SDK group helpers, SSE stream events, document-edit locks, schedule API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_groups` passed with `3` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_messages` passed with `23` tests.
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `81` tests.
#### Changed Files
- `server/models.py`
- `server/db.py`
- `server/main.py`
- `server/routes/groups.py`
- `server/routes/messages.py`
- `server/ws_hub.py`
- `tests/test_groups.py`
- `tests/test_messages.py`
- `tests/test_support.py`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 15:15 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Resumed from `WEB-VISUAL-2` and reviewed the current Web UI diff instead of starting a new backend slice.
- Verified the real login page and authenticated chat page with Chrome headless at desktop and 500px widths.
- Fixed a CSS cascade bug where `.drop-hint` overrode Tailwind `.hidden`, causing the drag/drop overlay to stay visible over the composer when no file was being dragged.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- `docs/USER.md` remains an untracked local credential note; it should not be committed as-is.
#### Next Plan
- Decide how to handle `docs/USER.md`, then commit the accepted Web UI visual changes.
- After Web UI is committed, choose the next backend/product slice: schedule API, Group/Hall, SSE, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- Chrome headless screenshots verified real login and authenticated chat pages; `#drop-hint` computed as `display: none` at 1440px and 500px.
#### Changed Files
- `web/style.css`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 11:35 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WEB-VISUAL-2` completed from the approved `image_gen` visual direction: the chat page now uses a `header + workspace-tools + messages + composer` structure.
- Online members and history/search controls are grouped into one workspace tools panel; the message timeline and composer now read as a single chat work area.
- The left channel/conversation area shown in the visual mockup remains deferred until the Group/Hall model exists, so the current page does not expose fake navigation.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Real authenticated chat-page acceptance still depends on manual review in the user's browser session or a dedicated non-private test account.
#### Next Plan
- If the layout is accepted, commit the Web UI visual changes; then return to backend model work, likely Group/Hall or SSE, so future navigation/sidebar UI has real data behind it.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` returned `200`.
- Chrome headless screenshot checks completed for the real login page and a temporary chat-shell preview at desktop and 500px widths.
#### Changed Files
- `web/index.html`
- `web/style.css`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 11:10 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WEB-VISUAL-1` completed: login/setup now uses a unified dark card treatment with Chinese copy, branded mark, clearer fields, and primary/secondary button hierarchy.
- Chat workspace styling was refreshed across header, presence strip, search toolbar, timeline background, message bubbles, reply/file cards, and bottom composer.
- Added responsive safeguards for narrow screens: constrained auth card width, wrapping toolbar controls, composer min-width fixes, and stronger long-message wrapping.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Real authenticated chat-page visual acceptance still depends on manual review or a provided non-private test login key; Codex in-app browser automation continues to time out when connecting.
#### Next Plan
- Review the visual result in a normal browser session; if accepted, commit and push `WEB-VISUAL-1`.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- Chrome headless screenshot checks completed for the real login page and a temporary chat-shell preview using the current served `style.css`.
- Codex in-app browser automation retry still timed out while connecting.

- `web/style.css`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:55 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Re-ran full backend regression after the Web UI polish changes; all `74` unit tests passed.
- Confirmed the local TALK service health endpoint still returns `status=ok`.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Visual acceptance still depends on browser/manual review; automated in-app browser control was previously timing out in this environment.
#### Next Plan
- Commit and push the Web UI polish changes if the current UI review scope is accepted.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz` returned `status=ok`.
- In-app browser automation retry against `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` timed out while connecting.
#### Changed Files
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:49 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `CHAT-UI-1` completed from browser review comments: search toolbar, composer controls, drag/drop hint, logout, remove-file, cancel-reply, and send/file labels are now Chinese.
- Search toolbar now separates primary search from secondary clear/load-more actions; composer now has a defined container and distinct file/input/send controls.
- Empty message timeline now shows a Chinese empty-state explanation instead of a visually unexplained blank area.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Visual acceptance still depends on manual refresh because Codex in-app browser automation is still timing out when connecting to the browser runtime.
#### Next Plan
- If the chat UI review is accepted, commit and push the Web UI polish changes.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.

- `SETUP-UX-2` follow-up completed: added cache-busting query strings for `/style.css` and `/app.js`, placed the create-admin button contrast styles directly in HTML classes, and replaced raw Clipboard API permission errors with Chinese copy-fallback guidance.
- If browser copy permission is denied, the setup key field is focused and selected so the user can press `Ctrl+C` manually.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Whether to replace the current API-key-first login model with a human password flow is a product/auth decision. Recommended direction is dual-mode auth: human password login with hashed password plus generated API keys for Agent/SDK use.
#### Next Plan
- If approved, design `AUTH-2`: password-based human login without breaking existing `X-API-Key` Agent authentication.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
#### Changed Files
- `web/index.html`
- `web/app.js`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:01 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SETUP-UX-2` completed from browser diff comments: added a visible `管理员 ID` format hint, changed `显示名称` to `昵称`, added client-side `human:*` validation, and restyled `创建管理员` as a compact bordered primary button.
- Synced `docs/MODULE_webui.md` to reflect the updated first-admin setup labels and ID-format hint.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- In-app browser automation currently times out while connecting to the browser runtime, so the page needs a manual refresh or later browser recheck for visual confirmation.
#### Next Plan
- Continue with the next local-lab slice after UI review is accepted: schedule API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` returned `200`.
#### Changed Files

- `web/style.css`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-13 16:07 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `TASK-1` completed: added `AgentTask` / `AgentTaskCreate` / `AgentTaskClaim` / `AgentTaskComplete` / `AgentTaskOut`, `/api/tasks`, database indexes, async SDK helpers, sync SDK wrappers, and documentation.
- Task API first slice supports creating queued tasks for existing `agent:*` members, listing visible tasks, Agent-only claim, and Agent-only completion as `succeeded` / `failed` / `canceled`.
- Task claim and completion now update linked `AgentInstance`: claim sets `busy` and `current_task_id`; success/cancel returns to `idle`; failure sets `error` and `last_error`.
- Project rule updated in `AGENTS.md`: development execution Agents may directly update `docs/PROGRESS.md` after actual code, test, or documentation work.
- Documentation synced across project brief, SDK, local-lab design, instances module, and new tasks module.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Schedule API is still not implemented: delayed / recurring trigger shape remains open.
- Retry, task timeout recovery, stale `running` cleanup, requeue/cancel UI, and Codex bridge task-queue consumption remain future work.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next local-lab slice: schedule API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
- If continuing scheduler work, define whether schedules create one-off tasks at trigger time and how failed scheduled tasks should be retried or surfaced.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_tasks` passed with `7` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_talk_client.TalkClientTests.test_task_helpers` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.

### 2026-05-13 15:47 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `INSTANCE-1` completed: added `AgentInstance` / `AgentInstanceUpdate` / `AgentInstanceOut`, `/api/instances`, database indexes, SDK helpers, and module documentation.
- Codex bridge now reports its runtime instance state with a stable optional `--instance-id`; task handling updates status to `busy`, success returns to `idle`, failures become `error`, and shutdown reports `offline`.
- Added coverage for instance API permissions, ownership protection, filters, invalid status validation, and SDK helpers.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Task and schedule API semantics are still not implemented: task table shape, retry behavior, process ownership, and scheduler/bridge responsibility split remain open.
- Group / Hall / SSE / document-lock implementation details remain pending after this instance-status foundation.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next local-lab slice: scheduler task API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, or document-edit lock API.
- When scheduler work starts, decide whether TALK launches bridge processes or only routes tasks to already-running instances.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_instances tests.test_talk_client tests.test_codex_bridge` passed with `19` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `66` tests.

### 2026-05-13 15:24 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Created an ignored local `.venv` from `requirements.txt`; dependency imports resolved consistently there (`pydantic 2.13.4`, `pydantic-core 2.46.4`, `fastapi 0.136.1`, `websockets 15.0.1`).
- Full regression passed: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` ran `60` tests successfully.
- Real Codex bridge smoke test passed with isolated temporary TALK server/database/storage: `human:smoke` sent `@agent:codex`, the bridge invoked real `codex exec --sandbox read-only`, and the reply used `reply_to` with content `TALK_BRIDGE_SMOKE_OK`.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Codex bridge remains MVP-level and still needs instance status, streaming, file/material handling, and document-lock integration.
- The `pi` framework path for DeepSeek / Kimi still needs local verification.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next implementation slice: bridge instance status, Group/Hall model, SSE streaming contract, or document-edit lock API.
- Continue the local-lab protocol design before broad service-model changes.

### 2026-05-13 15:10 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Added `docs/LOCAL_LAB_DESIGN.md` as the thin local-lab design note.
- Added `bridges/codex_bridge.py` as the Codex bridge MVP: direct text message in, configurable `codex exec` invocation, `reply_to` answer out.
- Added `docs/MODULE_bridges.md` and updated `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to register the new bridge module.
- Added `tests/test_codex_bridge.py` covering bridge routing, prompt construction, reply formatting, and subprocess stdin piping.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Real TALK server smoke test for Codex bridge remains pending.
- Full test suite is blocked by the local `.codex_pydeps` pydantic / pydantic-core mismatch.
#### Next Plan
- Clean or rebuild the Python dependency environment, then run full tests.
- Start TALK locally, run the Codex bridge, and verify one `@agent:codex` browser-to-bridge-to-reply loop.
- After the smoke test, continue with Group / Hall / SSE / instance-scheduler design and implementation.

### 2026-05-12 17:36 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Product decisions confirmed: DeepSeek / Kimi will use the locally installed `pi` framework; TALK should add Groups, Hall shared timeline mode, SSE streaming, and instance/scheduling API layers.
- A document editing coordination protocol is now required so multiple Agents do not edit the same document at the same time.
- Existing communication specs were checked. Current TALK supports member identity, API-key auth, server-side leading-mention routing, broadcast/direct/group-style `to_ids`, REST polling, WebSocket events, file exchange, replies, and SDK callbacks, but not a formal discussion protocol or document lock protocol.
- Temporary role decision: until the next progress summary, Codex may act as both decision Agent and execution Agent because the dedicated decision Agent is unavailable.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Document editing coordination still needs exact rules for lock scope, timeout, stale-lock recovery, conflict handling, and UI/API visibility.
- The local `pi` framework needs a quick workstation-level verification before bridge implementation.
#### Next Plan
- Write the next-phase local-lab design note covering bridge layout, `pi` integration, Groups, Hall, SSE, instance/scheduler APIs, and document-edit coordination.
- Define the first moderator-led multi-Agent discussion protocol before implementation.
- Implement the minimum local-lab path after the protocol and data model changes are stable.

### 2026-04-24 23:11 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DOC-2` completed: fixed the remaining mojibake deployment section in `CLAUDE.md`, added explicit UTF-8 write rules plus SDK import-path notes to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, and added `tests/test_encoding.py` as an encoding regression guard.
- Full regression still passes with `54` tests, including `3` new encoding-guard cases.
- The intended usage model is now explicit: TALK is a local home-LAN multi-Agent lab used on demand while the local computer is on, not a 24/7 permanently running service.
- The planned backend mix is now explicit: `Claude Code` / `Codex` through local CLI bridges, and `Kimi` / `DeepSeek` through API bridges.
- The next product direction is now explicit: moderator-led AI discussion with automatic transcript retention and support for passing shared documents/materials during the discussion.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The discussion phase still needs a concrete protocol for moderator behavior, round limits, material-sharing rules, and summary output.
#### Next Plan
- Write the next-phase design note for local experimental mode and one-command startup.
- Define a unified bridge contract for mixed CLI/API Agent backends.
- Define the first moderator-led discussion protocol with transcript retention, bounded rounds, and material passing.
- Implement the minimum local-lab path first, then return to lower-priority deployment validation tasks.

### 2026-04-24 22:01 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DOC-1` completed: split onboarding into `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` and `docs/QUICKSTART_AGENT.md`, and reduced `docs/QUICKSTART.md` to a short index page.
- `QUICKSTART_USER` now follows a family-user path with Docker Desktop, explicit browser verification, `config.toml` before/after examples, LAN IP lookup, and ordered troubleshooting.
- `QUICKSTART_AGENT` now follows a Python bare-metal + SDK path with PowerShell/bash command pairs, real example repo URLs, and a full runnable Agent sample.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` now includes prerequisites for Docker Compose, Linux `systemd`, and bare metal deployment.
- `docs/SDK.md` async examples now all include `asyncio.run(main())`, and `SETUP-1` now supports browser-side key generation, reveal/hide, and one-click copy in the first-admin UI.
- Related docs were synced after implementation, and full regression still passes with `51` unit tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The task card asks for a second clean-session newcomer dry run and readability feedback; that external acceptance has not been performed yet in this environment.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Run one real browser smoke test for `SETUP-1` on a fresh DB and confirm the first-run form, generated key, automatic sign-in, and second-open login behavior match the task card.
- Run one clean-session newcomer walkthrough against `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md`, collect friction points, and trim any remaining expert assumptions.

### 2026-04-24 19:25 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SETUP-1` completed: added unauthenticated `GET /api/setup/status`, CLI bootstrap script `scripts/create_admin.py`, Web UI first-run admin creation flow, and setup coverage in `tests/test_setup.py`.
- `QUICKSTART` and `DEPLOY` now document first-run bootstrap via the Web UI and `python scripts/create_admin.py`, including the Docker path `docker compose exec talk python scripts/create_admin.py`.
- The old onboarding blocker is removed at the code level: first human account creation no longer requires opening `/docs` and manually calling `POST /api/members`.
- Regression coverage expanded again; full `python -m unittest` is now green with `51` tests, including `3` new setup-specific cases.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- The new first-run setup flow has test coverage, but a real browser smoke test for “empty DB -> create admin -> auto login -> reopen -> normal login form” is still pending.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Run one real browser smoke test for `SETUP-1` on a fresh DB and confirm the first-run form, automatic sign-in, and second-open login behavior match the task card.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 20:39 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SDK-1` completed: added `TALK/client/` with async `TalkClient`, sync `TalkClientSync`, HTTP exception mapping, WebSocket-first event flow, reconnect plus HTTP polling fallback, message dedupe, and SDK docs/demo.
- `MSG-4` completed: added first-level message reply support across database, REST, WebSocket, Web UI, and SDK; reply summaries now travel with history and live events.
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, `deploy/talk.service`, `README.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md`, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, and bare-metal deployment paths.
- `SEC-1` completed: `GET /api/messages` now enforces visibility in SQL, aligns with WebSocket delivery semantics, and treats `to` as a narrowing filter rather than an access-control boundary.
- Regression coverage expanded across SDK and message flows; full `python -m unittest` is green with `48` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- First human account creation still relies on `/docs` plus `POST /api/members`; there is still no dedicated first-run bootstrap flow.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Decide whether to turn first human account creation into a dedicated bootstrap flow, or explicitly accept `/docs` as the administrator-only setup path for now.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 20:38 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SEC-1` completed: `GET /api/messages` now enforces message visibility in SQL and matches WebSocket delivery semantics instead of trusting the caller's `to` filter.
- `to=<member_id>` is now only a narrowing filter on the caller's visible set; `to=<other_member>` returns a safe pair view without exposing third-party private messages.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_messages.py` for third-party private message isolation, `to` filter escape attempts, broadcast visibility, pair-view filtering, and search visibility boundaries.
- Added startup indexes for `messages.from_id` and `messages.to_ids`, and updated `docs/MODULE_messages.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and `docs/SDK.md` to document the new server-enforced visibility contract.
- Full regression check passed: `python -m unittest` is green with `48` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.

### 2026-04-23 19:59 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, and `deploy/talk.service` to support Docker and systemd deployment paths.
- Added human-facing deployment docs: `README.md` as the root entry, `docs/QUICKSTART.md` for first install/login/use, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, bare-metal, reverse proxy, backup, and restore workflows.
- `CLAUDE.md` now points operators to the new deployment entry docs and templates.
- Docker docs now include writable path bootstrap steps for a clean machine: `storage/`, `logs/`, `backups/`, and `talk.db`.
- Regression check passed: `python -m unittest` remains green with `43` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup were not verified here.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- Outside `DEPLOY-1`, one known product-side gap remains: `GET /api/messages` history visibility still relies on the caller using the expected `to=<member_id>` view and is not yet fully tightened to WebSocket-level visibility semantics.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 19:57 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, and `deploy/talk.service` to support Docker and systemd deployment paths.
- Added human-facing deployment docs: `README.md` as the root entry, `docs/QUICKSTART.md` for first install/login/use, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, bare-metal, reverse proxy, backup, and restore workflows.
- `CLAUDE.md` now points operators to the new deployment entry docs and templates.

- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 19:48 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `MSG-4` completed: backend now supports first-level message replies via `messages.reply_to`, server-side validation, REST history reply summaries, and WebSocket payload parity.
- Web UI now supports reply composition, inline reply strips, jump-to-origin highlight, revoked-origin placeholder handling, and runtime config loading from public `GET /api/config`.
- `SDK-1` follow-up completed: `TALK/client/talk_client.py` now supports `reply_to` and `client.reply(message_id, text=...)`.
- Docs updated for `MODULE_messages`, `MODULE_webui`, and `PROJECT_BRIEF` addenda covering reply semantics and `/api/config`.
- Automated verification passed: `python -m unittest` is green with `43` total tests, including new reply/config coverage in `tests/test_messages.py` and the SDK reply shortcut test.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None
#### Next Plan
- Confirm the next product card after `MSG-4`; current reply support is intentionally flat and does not attempt nested thread rendering.
- If the next task stays in messaging, the highest-risk follow-up is tightening history visibility filtering in `GET /api/messages` so HTTP history matches WebSocket visibility more strictly.
- If manual UX acceptance is required, run the local browser flow for reply creation, jump-to-origin, revoke-after-reply, and `/api/config`-driven upload limit behavior.

### 2026-04-22 23:29 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WS-1` 已完成：WebSocket 心跳 `ping/pong`、空闲超时断开、入站 `send`、WS/REST 共用消息创建链路与鉴权重构均已落地。
- `FILE-1` 已完成：文件上传接入 `sha256` 秒传去重，采用 A 方案保留多条记录共享实体路径，并修正共享实体的过期清理逻辑。
- `OPS-1` 已完成：新增 `/healthz`、结构化日志、在线热备脚本、日志/备份配置段与运维文档，手动验收与自动化测试均通过。
- `MSG-3` 已完成：支持消息撤回、撤回态历史回放、WS `revoke` 实时同步、Web UI 撤回按钮与撤回占位渲染，文件消息撤回后实体保留。
- 当前全量自动化测试共 `30` 个 `unittest` 用例，`python -m unittest` 已全绿。
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None
#### Next Plan
- 继续推进下一个已确认任务卡，优先选择新的业务能力点，而不是重复打磨已通过验收的模块。
- 低优先清理两个工程尾项：`413` 弃用告警，以及前端撤回窗口时长与后端配置的统一读取方式。
- 保持后续任务的代码、模块文档与 `docs/PROGRESS.md` 同步更新。

### 2026-04-22 22:06 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- 在现有 `tests/` 骨架上继续扩完 `M3-4`：新增 `tests/test_websocket.py` 4 个 `unittest` 用例，覆盖无效 token 拒绝、首次 presence 快照、上下线 presence 变更、实时消息推送、`since` 对齐去重，以及断线后通过 HTTP `since` 补历史。
- 扩充 `tests/test_files.py` 4 个上传链路用例，覆盖成功上传落盘/落库、上传鉴权拒绝、超限文件拒绝、上传后 `type=file` 消息对 `filename / size_bytes / mime` 的快照冻结。
- 为了让基于 FastAPI `TestClient` 的自动化测试可直接运行，`requirements.txt` 已补入 `httpx>=0.27,<1`。
- 测试基类已补应用注入与隔离能力：`tests/test_support.py` 现在会把临时 SQLite 引擎注入 `server.main`，并在每个用例前后清空 `hub` 连接状态，避免 WS 单测串扰。
- 已同步更新 `docs/MODULE_websocket.md` 与 `docs/MODULE_files.md` 的当前实现现状和验收标准，反映本轮新增自动化覆盖。
- 当前全量自动化测试为 `15` 个 `unittest` 用例，已通过 `python -m unittest` 全量验证。
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None
#### Next Plan
- 如继续补 `M3-4`，优先补 WebSocket 广播路径与“同一成员多连接”场景，补齐 `MODULE_websocket` 里仍未打勾的验收项。
- 低优先处理进度文档收口：按既定建议评估是否把 `docs/PROGRESS.md` 的历史段进一步收敛到双文件结构。
- 后续每完成一项功能，继续同步对应模块文档与 `docs/PROGRESS.md`，避免进度积压。

### 2026-04-21 23:29 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- M2 核心链路已完成浏览器端整链路验收：登录、文本消息、文件发送、Agent 下载/回复、浏览器端下载、刷新后自动登录、WS 断开后轮询兜底均已验证通过。
- 成员鉴权链路已补齐：`GET /api/members/me` 已实现，`GET /api/members` 已要求鉴权；Web UI 登录已改为仅凭 API Key 自动识别当前成员。
- Web UI 已完成一轮细化：加入连接状态徽标、WS 自动重连（指数退避）、页内失败提示，不再依赖 `prompt` 和阻断式 `alert`。
- 文件消息协议已扩展：支持 `caption`，并在消息中冻结 `filename / size_bytes / mime` 快照；旧历史文件消息会在服务启动时按 `file_id` 自动回填这些字段。
- 消息接收者解析已下沉到服务端：`POST /api/messages` 现在会统一解析文本正文或文件附言开头的连续 `@mention`，优先以服务端解析结果决定 `to_ids`，无效 mention 返回 `400`；无开头 mention 时继续兼容显式 `to` 字段。
- Web UI 消息列表已完成一轮性能优化：历史消息改为分帧批量渲染，实时/轮询消息改为 `DocumentFragment` 批量插入，并用内存 `Set` 做去重，减少大批量消息下的 DOM 压力；同时修正了历史加载与 WS 并发时 `lastId` 被旧值回退的问题。
- Web UI 发送错误提示已收敛为直接回显服务端 `detail`，前端不再承担真实路由决策，只保留 `@` 自动补全和基础输入提示。
- M3 已启动：Web UI 已支持安全 Markdown 渲染、代码高亮和多行输入框（`Enter` 发送、`Shift+Enter` 换行），文本消息和文件附言都可直接展示结构化内容。

#### Next Plan
- 等待项目管理者确认文件生命周期策略，优先建议先明确“已被消息引用的文件是否永久保留”这一条基线规则。
- 策略确认后，按决策实现对应的文件保留/清理方案，并补充 API/前端在文件缺失场景下的用户可见行为。
- 在本轮已确认改动稳定后，同步更新 `docs/MODULE_messages.md`、`docs/MODULE_webui.md` 与 `docs/MODULE_files.md` 的实现状态描述。
