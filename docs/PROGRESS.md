# Project Progress

## Latest
Updated: 2026-05-14 10:55 (Asia/Shanghai)

### 1) Current Progress
- `INSTANCE-1` completed: added the `agent_instances` table, `/api/instances` status APIs, SDK helpers, and `docs/MODULE_instances.md`.
- Codex bridge now reports runtime status through TALK: startup `idle`, per-task `busy`, success back to `idle`, error/timeout to `error`, and shutdown to `offline`.
- Instance API coverage added in `tests/test_instances.py`; SDK helper coverage added in `tests/test_talk_client.py`.
- Instance bridge smoke test passed in an isolated temporary TALK server/database/storage: `agent:codex` followed `idle -> busy -> idle -> offline` and replied with `TALK_BRIDGE_INSTANCE_SMOKE_OK`.
- `TASK-1` completed: added `agent_tasks`, `/api/tasks`, SDK helpers, sync SDK wrappers, and route / SDK test coverage.
- First scheduler boundary is now explicit: TALK records and routes tasks to already-running bridge processes; it does not auto-start Codex / Claude / pi processes in this slice.
- Task lifecycle first version supports `queued -> running -> succeeded / failed / canceled`; task claim and completion update linked instance status and `current_task_id`.
- Project rules updated: development execution Agents may directly update `docs/PROGRESS.md` after real code, test, or documentation work.
- Documentation synced: `docs/MODULE_tasks.md` added; `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/MODULE_instances.md`, `docs/LOCAL_LAB_DESIGN.md`, and `docs/SDK.md` updated for task APIs.
- `SETUP-UX-2` completed: first-admin setup page now shows the `管理员 ID` format hint, renames `显示名称` to `昵称`, validates `human:*` before submit, and changes the create-admin button to a compact bordered primary button with stronger contrast.
- `SETUP-UX-2` follow-up: setup page now cache-busts `style.css` / `app.js`, puts primary button contrast classes directly on the button, and localizes clipboard failure into a Chinese fallback that selects the login key for manual `Ctrl+C` copy.
- `CHAT-UI-1` completed: chat page residual English copy was localized, search toolbar and composer controls were visually separated, and the empty message timeline now explains its purpose.

### 2) Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The improved first-run setup flow still lacks one real browser smoke test for “empty DB -> create admin -> auto login -> reopen -> normal login form”.
- The task card asks for a second clean-session newcomer dry run and readability feedback; that external acceptance has not been performed yet in this environment.
- The multi-Agent discussion phase still needs a concrete protocol: moderator responsibilities, round limits, stop conditions, material-sharing rules, and summary output format are discussed conceptually but not yet written into an implementation spec.
- The document editing coordination protocol still needs implementation-level rules: lock granularity, lock timeout, stale-lock recovery, read-only review behavior, conflict handling, and UI/API visibility.
- The local `pi` framework entrypoint, configuration style, and DeepSeek / Kimi adapter shape still need to be verified on this workstation before bridge implementation.
- Codex bridge is still MVP-level: it does not yet stream partial output, attach files/materials, or enforce document-edit locks.
- Scheduler v2 details remain open: delayed / recurring schedule table shape, task retry policy, timeout recovery for stale `running` tasks, and whether Web UI can manually requeue or cancel tasks.

### 3) Next Plan
- Continue refining the unified bridge contract for hybrid backends: local CLI bridges for `Claude Code` / `Codex`, `pi`-based bridges for `Kimi` / `DeepSeek`, and a shared TALK-facing message/file interface.
- Define the first multi-Agent discussion protocol: moderator-led turns, bounded rounds, automatic transcript retention, summary generation, controlled material/document passing, and document-edit coordination.
- Design the required product model changes before implementation: Groups / rooms, Hall shared timeline, SSE stream events, Agent instances, and scheduling APIs.
- Next implementation candidates: schedule API, Group/Hall data model, SSE stream event contract, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.

### 4) Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_tasks` passed with `7` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_talk_client.TalkClientTests.test_task_helpers` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- After the Web UI polish changes, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` was rerun and passed with `74` tests.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` returned `200`; in-app browser automation connection still timed out before refresh, so visual recheck is pending manual refresh.
- A follow-up in-app browser automation attempt against `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` timed out again during browser connection; `/healthz` remained healthy.

## History

### 2026-05-14 10:55 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Re-ran full backend regression after the Web UI polish changes; all `74` unit tests passed.
- Confirmed the local TALK service health endpoint still returns `status=ok`.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Visual acceptance still depends on browser/manual review; automated in-app browser control was previously timing out in this environment.
#### Next Plan
- Commit and push the Web UI polish changes if the current UI review scope is accepted.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz` returned `status=ok`.
- In-app browser automation retry against `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` timed out while connecting.
#### Changed Files
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:49 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `CHAT-UI-1` completed from browser review comments: search toolbar, composer controls, drag/drop hint, logout, remove-file, cancel-reply, and send/file labels are now Chinese.
- Search toolbar now separates primary search from secondary clear/load-more actions; composer now has a defined container and distinct file/input/send controls.
- Empty message timeline now shows a Chinese empty-state explanation instead of a visually unexplained blank area.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Visual acceptance still depends on manual refresh because Codex in-app browser automation is still timing out when connecting to the browser runtime.
#### Next Plan
- If the chat UI review is accepted, commit and push the Web UI polish changes.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
#### Changed Files
- `web/index.html`
- `web/app.js`
- `web/style.css`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:15 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SETUP-UX-2` follow-up completed: added cache-busting query strings for `/style.css` and `/app.js`, placed the create-admin button contrast styles directly in HTML classes, and replaced raw Clipboard API permission errors with Chinese copy-fallback guidance.
- If browser copy permission is denied, the setup key field is focused and selected so the user can press `Ctrl+C` manually.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Whether to replace the current API-key-first login model with a human password flow is a product/auth decision. Recommended direction is dual-mode auth: human password login with hashed password plus generated API keys for Agent/SDK use.
#### Next Plan
- If approved, design `AUTH-2`: password-based human login without breaking existing `X-API-Key` Agent authentication.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed with line-ending warnings only.
#### Changed Files
- `web/index.html`
- `web/app.js`
- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-14 10:01 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SETUP-UX-2` completed from browser diff comments: added a visible `管理员 ID` format hint, changed `显示名称` to `昵称`, added client-side `human:*` validation, and restyled `创建管理员` as a compact bordered primary button.
- Synced `docs/MODULE_webui.md` to reflect the updated first-admin setup labels and ID-format hint.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- In-app browser automation currently times out while connecting to the browser runtime, so the page needs a manual refresh or later browser recheck for visual confirmation.
#### Next Plan
- Continue with the next local-lab slice after UI review is accepted: schedule API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
#### Verification
- `node --check web\app.js` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_encoding` passed with `3` tests.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` returned `200`.
#### Changed Files

- `docs/MODULE_webui.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`

### 2026-05-13 16:07 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `TASK-1` completed: added `AgentTask` / `AgentTaskCreate` / `AgentTaskClaim` / `AgentTaskComplete` / `AgentTaskOut`, `/api/tasks`, database indexes, async SDK helpers, sync SDK wrappers, and documentation.
- Task API first slice supports creating queued tasks for existing `agent:*` members, listing visible tasks, Agent-only claim, and Agent-only completion as `succeeded` / `failed` / `canceled`.
- Task claim and completion now update linked `AgentInstance`: claim sets `busy` and `current_task_id`; success/cancel returns to `idle`; failure sets `error` and `last_error`.
- Project rule updated in `AGENTS.md`: development execution Agents may directly update `docs/PROGRESS.md` after actual code, test, or documentation work.
- Documentation synced across project brief, SDK, local-lab design, instances module, and new tasks module.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Schedule API is still not implemented: delayed / recurring trigger shape remains open.
- Retry, task timeout recovery, stale `running` cleanup, requeue/cancel UI, and Codex bridge task-queue consumption remain future work.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next local-lab slice: schedule API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, document-edit lock API, or Codex bridge task-queue integration.
- If continuing scheduler work, define whether schedules create one-off tasks at trigger time and how failed scheduled tasks should be retried or surfaced.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_tasks` passed with `7` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_talk_client.TalkClientTests.test_task_helpers` passed.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `74` tests.

### 2026-05-13 15:47 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `INSTANCE-1` completed: added `AgentInstance` / `AgentInstanceUpdate` / `AgentInstanceOut`, `/api/instances`, database indexes, SDK helpers, and module documentation.
- Codex bridge now reports its runtime instance state with a stable optional `--instance-id`; task handling updates status to `busy`, success returns to `idle`, failures become `error`, and shutdown reports `offline`.
- Added coverage for instance API permissions, ownership protection, filters, invalid status validation, and SDK helpers.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Task and schedule API semantics are still not implemented: task table shape, retry behavior, process ownership, and scheduler/bridge responsibility split remain open.
- Group / Hall / SSE / document-lock implementation details remain pending after this instance-status foundation.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next local-lab slice: scheduler task API, Group/Hall room model, SSE stream contract, or document-edit lock API.
- When scheduler work starts, decide whether TALK launches bridge processes or only routes tasks to already-running instances.
#### Verification
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest tests.test_instances tests.test_talk_client tests.test_codex_bridge` passed with `19` tests.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` passed with `66` tests.
- Isolated bridge instance smoke passed: `idle -> busy -> idle -> offline`, reply content `TALK_BRIDGE_INSTANCE_SMOKE_OK`.

### 2026-05-13 15:24 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Created an ignored local `.venv` from `requirements.txt`; dependency imports resolved consistently there (`pydantic 2.13.4`, `pydantic-core 2.46.4`, `fastapi 0.136.1`, `websockets 15.0.1`).
- Full regression passed: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest` ran `60` tests successfully.
- Real Codex bridge smoke test passed with isolated temporary TALK server/database/storage: `human:smoke` sent `@agent:codex`, the bridge invoked real `codex exec --sandbox read-only`, and the reply used `reply_to` with content `TALK_BRIDGE_SMOKE_OK`.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Codex bridge remains MVP-level and still needs instance status, streaming, file/material handling, and document-lock integration.
- The `pi` framework path for DeepSeek / Kimi still needs local verification.
#### Next Plan
- Choose the next implementation slice: bridge instance status, Group/Hall model, SSE streaming contract, or document-edit lock API.
- Continue the local-lab protocol design before broad service-model changes.

### 2026-05-13 15:10 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Added `docs/LOCAL_LAB_DESIGN.md` as the thin local-lab design note.
- Added `bridges/codex_bridge.py` as the Codex bridge MVP: direct text message in, configurable `codex exec` invocation, `reply_to` answer out.
- Added `docs/MODULE_bridges.md` and updated `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to register the new bridge module.
- Added `tests/test_codex_bridge.py` covering bridge routing, prompt construction, reply formatting, and subprocess stdin piping.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Real TALK server smoke test for Codex bridge remains pending.
- Full test suite is blocked by the local `.codex_pydeps` pydantic / pydantic-core mismatch.
#### Next Plan
- Clean or rebuild the Python dependency environment, then run full tests.
- Start TALK locally, run the Codex bridge, and verify one `@agent:codex` browser-to-bridge-to-reply loop.
- After the smoke test, continue with Group / Hall / SSE / instance-scheduler design and implementation.

### 2026-05-12 17:36 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- Product decisions confirmed: DeepSeek / Kimi will use the locally installed `pi` framework; TALK should add Groups, Hall shared timeline mode, SSE streaming, and instance/scheduling API layers.
- A document editing coordination protocol is now required so multiple Agents do not edit the same document at the same time.
- Existing communication specs were checked. Current TALK supports member identity, API-key auth, server-side leading-mention routing, broadcast/direct/group-style `to_ids`, REST polling, WebSocket events, file exchange, replies, and SDK callbacks, but not a formal discussion protocol or document lock protocol.
- Temporary role decision: until the next progress summary, Codex may act as both decision Agent and execution Agent because the dedicated decision Agent is unavailable.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Document editing coordination still needs exact rules for lock scope, timeout, stale-lock recovery, conflict handling, and UI/API visibility.
- The local `pi` framework needs a quick workstation-level verification before bridge implementation.
#### Next Plan
- Write the next-phase local-lab design note covering bridge layout, `pi` integration, Groups, Hall, SSE, instance/scheduler APIs, and document-edit coordination.
- Define the first moderator-led multi-Agent discussion protocol before implementation.
- Implement the minimum local-lab path after the protocol and data model changes are stable.

### 2026-04-24 23:11 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DOC-2` completed: fixed the remaining mojibake deployment section in `CLAUDE.md`, added explicit UTF-8 write rules plus SDK import-path notes to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, and added `tests/test_encoding.py` as an encoding regression guard.
- Full regression still passes with `54` tests, including `3` new encoding-guard cases.
- The intended usage model is now explicit: TALK is a local home-LAN multi-Agent lab used on demand while the local computer is on, not a 24/7 permanently running service.
- The planned backend mix is now explicit: `Claude Code` / `Codex` through local CLI bridges, and `Kimi` / `DeepSeek` through API bridges.
- The next product direction is now explicit: moderator-led AI discussion with automatic transcript retention and support for passing shared documents/materials during the discussion.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The discussion phase still needs a concrete protocol for moderator behavior, round limits, material-sharing rules, and summary output.
#### Next Plan
- Write the next-phase design note for local experimental mode and one-command startup.
- Define a unified bridge contract for mixed CLI/API Agent backends.
- Define the first moderator-led discussion protocol with transcript retention, bounded rounds, and material passing.
- Implement the minimum local-lab path first, then return to lower-priority deployment validation tasks.

### 2026-04-24 22:01 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DOC-1` completed: split onboarding into `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` and `docs/QUICKSTART_AGENT.md`, and reduced `docs/QUICKSTART.md` to a short index page.
- `QUICKSTART_USER` now follows a family-user path with Docker Desktop, explicit browser verification, `config.toml` before/after examples, LAN IP lookup, and ordered troubleshooting.
- `QUICKSTART_AGENT` now follows a Python bare-metal + SDK path with PowerShell/bash command pairs, real example repo URLs, and a full runnable Agent sample.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` now includes prerequisites for Docker Compose, Linux `systemd`, and bare metal deployment.
- `docs/SDK.md` async examples now all include `asyncio.run(main())`, and `SETUP-1` now supports browser-side key generation, reveal/hide, and one-click copy in the first-admin UI.
- Related docs were synced after implementation, and full regression still passes with `51` unit tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be hidden onboarding assumptions.
- The task card asks for a second clean-session newcomer dry run and readability feedback; that external acceptance has not been performed yet in this environment.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Run one real browser smoke test for `SETUP-1` on a fresh DB and confirm the first-run form, generated key, automatic sign-in, and second-open login behavior match the task card.
- Run one clean-session newcomer walkthrough against `docs/QUICKSTART_USER.md`, collect friction points, and trim any remaining expert assumptions.

### 2026-04-24 19:25 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SETUP-1` completed: added unauthenticated `GET /api/setup/status`, CLI bootstrap script `scripts/create_admin.py`, Web UI first-run admin creation flow, and setup coverage in `tests/test_setup.py`.
- `QUICKSTART` and `DEPLOY` now document first-run bootstrap via the Web UI and `python scripts/create_admin.py`, including the Docker path `docker compose exec talk python scripts/create_admin.py`.
- The old onboarding blocker is removed at the code level: first human account creation no longer requires opening `/docs` and manually calling `POST /api/members`.
- Regression coverage expanded again; full `python -m unittest` is now green with `51` tests, including `3` new setup-specific cases.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- The new first-run setup flow has test coverage, but a real browser smoke test for “empty DB -> create admin -> auto login -> reopen -> normal login form” is still pending.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Run one real browser smoke test for `SETUP-1` on a fresh DB and confirm the first-run form, automatic sign-in, and second-open login behavior match the task card.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 20:39 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SDK-1` completed: added `TALK/client/` with async `TalkClient`, sync `TalkClientSync`, HTTP exception mapping, WebSocket-first event flow, reconnect plus HTTP polling fallback, message dedupe, and SDK docs/demo.
- `MSG-4` completed: added first-level message reply support across database, REST, WebSocket, Web UI, and SDK; reply summaries now travel with history and live events.
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, `deploy/talk.service`, `README.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md`, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, and bare-metal deployment paths.
- `SEC-1` completed: `GET /api/messages` now enforces visibility in SQL, aligns with WebSocket delivery semantics, and treats `to` as a narrowing filter rather than an access-control boundary.
- Regression coverage expanded across SDK and message flows; full `python -m unittest` is green with `48` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- First human account creation still relies on `/docs` plus `POST /api/members`; there is still no dedicated first-run bootstrap flow.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Decide whether to turn first human account creation into a dedicated bootstrap flow, or explicitly accept `/docs` as the administrator-only setup path for now.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 20:38 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `SEC-1` completed: `GET /api/messages` now enforces message visibility in SQL and matches WebSocket delivery semantics instead of trusting the caller's `to` filter.
- `to=<member_id>` is now only a narrowing filter on the caller's visible set; `to=<other_member>` returns a safe pair view without exposing third-party private messages.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_messages.py` for third-party private message isolation, `to` filter escape attempts, broadcast visibility, pair-view filtering, and search visibility boundaries.
- Added startup indexes for `messages.from_id` and `messages.to_ids`, and updated `docs/MODULE_messages.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, and `docs/SDK.md` to document the new server-enforced visibility contract.
- Full regression check passed: `python -m unittest` is green with `48` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup are still unverified.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- First human account creation still relies on `/docs` plus `POST /api/members`; there is still no dedicated first-run bootstrap flow.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Decide whether to turn first human account creation into a dedicated bootstrap flow, or explicitly accept `/docs` as the administrator-only setup path for now.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 19:59 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, and `deploy/talk.service` to support Docker and systemd deployment paths.
- Added human-facing deployment docs: `README.md` as the root entry, `docs/QUICKSTART.md` for first install/login/use, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, bare-metal, reverse proxy, backup, and restore workflows.
- `CLAUDE.md` now points operators to the new deployment entry docs and templates.
- Docker docs now include writable path bootstrap steps for a clean machine: `storage/`, `logs/`, `backups/`, and `talk.db`.
- Regression check passed: `python -m unittest` remains green with `43` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup were not verified here.
- `deploy/talk.service` and the Linux deployment path are documented but not yet validated on a clean Linux host.
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` has not yet been run end-to-end by a first-time non-project user, so there may still be onboarding friction.
- Outside `DEPLOY-1`, one known product-side gap remains: `GET /api/messages` history visibility still relies on the caller using the expected `to=<member_id>` view and is not yet fully tightened to WebSocket-level visibility semantics.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 19:57 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `DEPLOY-1` completed: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, and `deploy/talk.service` to support Docker and systemd deployment paths.
- Added human-facing deployment docs: `README.md` as the root entry, `docs/QUICKSTART.md` for first install/login/use, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for Docker, systemd, bare-metal, reverse proxy, backup, and restore workflows.
- `CLAUDE.md` now points operators to the new deployment entry docs and templates.
- Docker docs now include writable path bootstrap steps for a clean machine: `storage/`, `logs/`, `backups/`, and `talk.db`.
- Regression check passed: `python -m unittest` remains green with `43` tests.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- Docker was not available in the current workstation environment, so `docker compose config` and real container startup were not verified here.
#### Next Plan
- Run one real Docker smoke test on a machine with Docker: `docker compose up -d --build`, open Web UI, create one account, send one message, upload one file, then restart and confirm persistence.
- Run one real Linux host smoke test for `deploy/talk.service` following `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- Collect first-run feedback from a non-project user against `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and remove any remaining setup friction.

### 2026-04-23 19:48 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `MSG-4` completed: backend now supports first-level message replies via `messages.reply_to`, server-side validation, REST history reply summaries, and WebSocket payload parity.
- Web UI now supports reply composition, inline reply strips, jump-to-origin highlight, revoked-origin placeholder handling, and runtime config loading from public `GET /api/config`.
- `SDK-1` follow-up completed: `TALK/client/talk_client.py` now supports `reply_to` and `client.reply(message_id, text=...)`.
- Docs updated for `MODULE_messages`, `MODULE_webui`, and `PROJECT_BRIEF` addenda covering reply semantics and `/api/config`.
- Automated verification passed: `python -m unittest` is green with `43` total tests, including new reply/config coverage in `tests/test_messages.py` and the SDK reply shortcut test.
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None
#### Next Plan
- Confirm the next product card after `MSG-4`; current reply support is intentionally flat and does not attempt nested thread rendering.
- If the next task stays in messaging, the highest-risk follow-up is tightening history visibility filtering in `GET /api/messages` so HTTP history matches WebSocket visibility more strictly.
- If manual UX acceptance is required, run the local browser flow for reply creation, jump-to-origin, revoke-after-reply, and `/api/config`-driven upload limit behavior.

### 2026-04-22 23:29 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- `WS-1` 已完成：WebSocket 心跳 `ping/pong`、空闲超时断开、入站 `send`、WS/REST 共用消息创建链路与鉴权重构均已落地。
- `FILE-1` 已完成：文件上传接入 `sha256` 秒传去重，采用 A 方案保留多条记录共享实体路径，并修正共享实体的过期清理逻辑。
- `OPS-1` 已完成：新增 `/healthz`、结构化日志、在线热备脚本、日志/备份配置段与运维文档，手动验收与自动化测试均通过。
- `MSG-3` 已完成：支持消息撤回、撤回态历史回放、WS `revoke` 实时同步、Web UI 撤回按钮与撤回占位渲染，文件消息撤回后实体保留。
- 当前全量自动化测试共 `30` 个 `unittest` 用例，`python -m unittest` 已全绿。
#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- None
#### Next Plan
- 继续推进下一个已确认任务卡，优先选择新的业务能力点，而不是重复打磨已通过验收的模块。
- 低优先清理两个工程尾项：`413` 弃用告警，以及前端撤回窗口时长与后端配置的统一读取方式。
- 保持后续任务的代码、模块文档与 `docs/PROGRESS.md` 同步更新。

### 2026-04-22 22:06 (Asia/Shanghai)
#### Current Progress
- 在现有 `tests/` 骨架上继续扩完 `M3-4`：新增 `tests/test_websocket.py` 4 个 `unittest` 用例，覆盖无效 token 拒绝、首次 presence 快照、上下线 presence 变更、实时消息推送、`since` 对齐去重，以及断线后通过 HTTP `since` 补历史。
- 扩充 `tests/test_files.py` 4 个上传链路用例，覆盖成功上传落盘/落库、上传鉴权拒绝、超限文件拒绝、上传后 `type=file` 消息对 `filename / size_bytes / mime` 的快照冻结。
- 为了让基于 FastAPI `TestClient` 的自动化测试可直接运行，`requirements.txt` 已补入 `httpx>=0.27,<1`。
- 测试基类已补应用注入与隔离能力：`tests/test_support.py` 现在会把临时 SQLite 引擎注入 `server.main`，并在每个用例前后清空 `hub` 连接状态，避免 WS 单测串扰。
- 已同步更新 `docs/MODULE_websocket.md` 与 `docs/MODULE_files.md` 的当前实现现状和验收标准，反映本轮新增自动化覆盖。
- 当前全量自动化测试为 `15` 个 `unittest` 用例，已通过 `python -m unittest` 全量验证。

- M2 核心能力已基本落地：文件上传下载 API、Web UI 文件收发、示例 Agent 文件收发已完成。
- 文件 API、静态资源路由和示例 Agent 的基础链路已在隔离环境中验证通过。
- 浏览器端 Web UI 仍待整链路手动验收。

#### Open Questions / Pending Confirmation
- 下一步优先做 `/api/me` 还是继续细化 Web UI。
- 是否安装 auto-resume hook 到 `~/.claude/settings.json`。

#### Next Plan
- 先完成浏览器端整链路验收，再决定 `/api/me` 与 Web UI 细化的优先级。
